<p>
In radio and telecommunications a dipole antenna or doublet[1] is the simplest and most widely used class of antenna.[2][3] The
dipole is any one of a class of antennas producing a radiation pattern approximating that of an elementary electric dipole with a
radiating structure supporting a line current so energized that the current has only one node at each end.[4] A dipole antenna
commonly consists of two identical conductive elements[5] such as metal wires or rods, which are usually bilaterally
symmetrical.[3][6][7] The driving current from the transmitter is applied, or for receiving antennas the output signal to the receiver is
taken, between the two halves of the antenna. Each side of the feedline to the transmitter or receiver is connected to one of the
conductors. A common example of a dipole is the "rabbit ears" television antenna found on broadcast television sets.

<h1> about </h1>
<p>
The term "dipole" is used for historical reasons to differentiate it from monopole antennas, which consist of a single rod or
conductor connected to one side of the feedline, and the other side connected to some type of ground.[7] However "monopole" is
somewhat of a misnomer[8] since the source exciting far-field radiation can only be an oscillating electric dipole (or magnetic
dipole), never a higher multipole order (quadrupole, octupole, etc.) nor a monopole (isolated
positive or negative charge). The feedline injects an equal and opposite current into the ground (or
ground plane) as it supplies to the radiating element, resulting in fields and currents at and above
ground of the same form as for a dipole with two such elements opposite each other. Thus monopole
antennas are best analyzed in terms of equivalent dipoles as is described below.
